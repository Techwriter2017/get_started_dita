  <title>Chapter 9: Emphasizing Important Information</title>
  <shortdesc>Summary from <i>Technical Communication</i> by Mike Markel.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>This chapter taught us about how to write so that important information is easily accessible
      and understood. Here are some important points:</p>
    <ul id="ul_k5r_lmc_mz">
      <li>Make sure that the titles and headings are informative. The titles and headings should
        describe the section, and be indented id a way to highlight relative importance of the
        information.</li>
      <li>Separate out the important information into a list. The list can have the important phases
        bolded and can have explanatory sentences following the bolded phrases.</li>
      <li>Structure paragraphs so that the important information comes first. Then, any supporting
        sentences can follow.</li>
      <li>Divide paragraphs into manageable chunks. Find logical places to break paragraphs into
        fewer sentences so that there is not so much information for the reader to understand or
        remember.</li>
      <li>Use transitional word and phases to convey meaning. Transitional words show relationships
        and include words like also, likewise, although, above, and finally among many other words
        listed on page 209.</li>
    </ul>
