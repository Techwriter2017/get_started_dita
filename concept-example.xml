  <conbody>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that you use with your webpages to turn webpages into a
      program. It allows the developer to gather input and manipulate the webpage after the webpage
      has been loaded.  </p>
    <p>Javascript is deeply embedded with the browser.  It uses an event driven model which means
      that the event is not run until the event is triggered.</p>
