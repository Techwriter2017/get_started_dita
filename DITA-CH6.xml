  <title>Chapter 6: Researching Your Subject</title>
  <shortdesc>Summary from <i>Technical Communication</i> by Mike Markel.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>The main purpose of searching a subject is to get answers to questions. You may need an
      answer to a </p>
    <p>practical question such as “Should tablets replace notebooks in the workplace?”.
      Alternatively, you may </p>
    <p>need to answer scholarly questions. Whether you are searching for answers to practical
      questions or </p>
    <p>scholarly questions, your research will fall into two main types:</p>
    <ul id="ul_xgj_qlc_mz">
      <li>Primary research—research where you discover or create the information yourself.</li>
      <li>Secondary research—you find information that other people have discovered or created.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Good research is planned. The audience, purpose, and subject need to be analyzed to narrow
      down the </p>
    <p>scope of the project. Budgets, time schedules and the form of the final documentation need to
      be worked out. </p>
    <p>You will essential to determine how much to research, how much research will actually be
      summarized in the </p>
    <p>document, and how much research is needed to provide you with enough background knowledge
      that you can </p>
    <p>understand and write to your audience.</p>
    <p> Before you start researching, it is helpful to write out the questions that you need to
      answer. </p>
    <p>Then you will need to be persistent to find the answers to your questions. You will want to
      have a system </p>
    <p>for recording or managing the information that you find. Finally, you will want to make sure
      that you have </p>
    <p>triangulated the information. That means that you found 3 different sources that answer the
      question in </p>
    <p>three different ways. </p>
    <p> You can find information in traditional form, online social media, or forms that you
      generate yourself:</p>
    <ul id="ul_bkb_tlc_mz">
      <li>Traditional form includes print, online databases or catalogs, reference works,
        periodicals, newspapers, </li>
      <li>abstracts, and government information. </li>
      <li>Online social media includes online discussion boards, wikis, blogs, tagged content, and
        RSS feeds. You </li>
      <li>will need to evaluate the information that you find for accuracy, bias, completeness,
        appropriateness, </li>
      <li>clarity, and timeliness. </li>
      <li>Forms that you generate yourself include observations, field research, inspections,
        demonstrations </li>
      <li>(as the case with software programs), interviews, questionnaires, inquiries, and
        surveys.</li>
      <li> Regardless of where you get the research, it must be accurate and you must be honest in
        how you use it.</li>
    </ul>
